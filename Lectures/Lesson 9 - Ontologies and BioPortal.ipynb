    "# Exploration of Ontologies and Ontology Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Our discussion of Linked Data very quickly led us to a discussion of Ontologies.  Ontologies are what make it possible for a machine to understand the **content** of Linked Data - where Linked Data provides a machine-readable **structure** (provided by RDF), Ontologies provide machine-interpretable **semantics** (i.e., they define the _meaning_ of the data within that structure).   \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we look at Linked Data in any more detail, we should look more closely at Ontologies - What are they?  Where do you find them? How do you use them in Linked Data?  What kinds of tools are available to make your analyses easier using ontologies?\n",

    "\n",
    "# Start with Gene Ontology\n",
    "\n",
    "I am using Pascale Gaudet's [Gene Ontology lecture notes](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7FLMiAz5IXPZ05NUnFTLUh5VjA)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# GO is only one!\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gene Ontology is only one of many ontologies in the life sciences.  Most (not all) life science ontologies are deposited in a central location called the [BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/), from the (USA) National Center for Biomedical Ontology.   Surf there now...\n",
    "\n",
    "After we [explore the JSON interface](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xjHyHTSrFpYdg10QqLOvLI5WCuw8dbfZZLmay8qm6OQ) for the Annotator tool, we will use it to add to our bibliographic script created in the last lesson.\n",

    "YOUR TASK:  Create the Ruby that:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Retrieves the bibliographic references for the first 5 \"Wilkinson MD\"[AUTH] matches in NCBI PubMed\n",
    "    * takes each of the TITLES\n",
    "    * send them (one at a time) to the annotator\n",
    "    * extract the ontology terms (which ontology, and its ID, and its label e.g. --> GO : 0003456 : \"Apoptosis\"\n",
