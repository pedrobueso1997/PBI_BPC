                A few days ago, Mark Wilkinson gave me the 4 GFF files you had prepared. As you know, they include the poly-A tail of \
                millions of transcripts from Magnaporthe oryzae under various conditions. It is probably a bit tedious to retrieve information \
                from these files... but don't worry! This website will free you from such a task. Just write the gene id you are interested \
                in and the webpage will show the polyA sites it contains and under which conditions they appear. It also includes some \
                information on the gene, which might be of interest. Give it a try!"} +
